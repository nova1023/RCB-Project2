Github workflow: 

The general idea. While on your local master, pull down the changes from the remote master.

	- Then switch over to your personal branch, and merge the changes in from the local master.

Absolute beginning:

- Clone the repo
	 
	git clone repoURLGoesHere

- Enter the repo

	cd repoName

- To checkout what branch you’re currently on, as well as all the branches on your local machine:

	git branch

- Make your own branch (only have to make your own branch once)

	git checkout -b yourBranchNameGoesHere(put your first name)

	//The above command both creates a new branch and switches over to it

- Make your changes 

When you’re ready to commit and push up

- Add the files you’ve changed 

	git add <files>

- make your commit
	
	git commit -m “Message describing what you’ve changed here.”

- push your branch up to the remote repository

	git push origin yourBranchNameHere

- Create a pull request on the github website

Pulling down to keep your local up to date

- Switch over to your local master

	git checkout master

- Pull down from the remote

	git pull

- Your local master is now up to date with the remote master.

- We now want to bring your local user branch up to date with the master

- Switch over to your user branch

	git checkout yourBranchNameHere

- Now we want to merge the changes from the master into your branch

	git merge master

- Your branch is now up to date.
